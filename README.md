# J-Tools
This is my personal code library that I use between projects. Most of it is just to save time really. Just though I'd make a packaged version to make it easier to transfer between projects and ley others use it if they wish. There is no documentation for this at this time, I do plan to add some, but it's pretty far down the to-do list. Most scripts are commented with the normal XML comments so that should help here and there. 

## How To Install
This repo is designed to be installed via the Package manager in Unity. Just go to Window/Package Manager, under the + option use "Add package via git URL". Then copy the text below into the field and click add.

That's it, that package will import and you should be all set to use the library.
